Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n\n Options: A: Discharge the patient with a plan for home health care and physical therapy B: Inform the patient that she would need to sign out against medical advice C: Inform the patient that transfer to a long-term care facility is most suitable for her D: Request psychiatric evaluation of the patient's decision-making capacity", "answer": "Discharge the patient with a plan for home health care and physical therapy", "rationale": "The patient has shown significant progress in her rehabilitation, has stable vital signs, intact cognitive function, good social support at home, and no significant medical issues that would require prolonged hospitalization. Discharging her with a plan for home health care and physical therapy allows her to continue her recovery in a familiar and supportive environment while receiving the necessary assistance to ensure her safety and progress."}
{"question": "A 52-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She received the diagnosis of hypertension 3 weeks ago, and lisinopril therapy was begun at that time. She has had a constant, nonproductive, hacking cough for 2 weeks but has not had any other problems. She has no history of serious illness and takes no other medications. She does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine daily. She does aerobic exercise for 30 minutes four to five times weekly. Her blood pressure has decreased from 164/92 mm Hg 3 weeks ago to 140/84 mm Hg today. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient's cough?\n\n Options: A: Pulmonary function tests B: CT scan of the chest C: Course of prednisone D: Discontinuation of lisinopril E: Use of a cough suppressant F: No change in management is indicated at this time", "answer": "Discontinuation of lisinopril", "rationale": "The patient's presentation of a constant, nonproductive cough that started after initiating lisinopril therapy suggests a possible adverse effect of the medication known as ACE inhibitor-induced cough. The most appropriate next step in management is discontinuation of lisinopril to address the cough."}
{"question": "A 32-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of cold intolerance, constipation, and severe fatigue. She also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight gain during this period. Her current medication is daily levothyroxine. She also started taking calcium carbonate supplements 2 months ago for osteopenia of the lumbar spine. At that time, serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) were within the reference ranges. Today, physical examination shows coarse, dry skin. Serum studies show a TSH concentration of 16.6 \u03bcU/mL and FT4 concentration of 0.3 ng/dL. Which of the following pharmacokinetic changes of levothyroxine is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s current condition? Options: A: Decreased absorption B: Decreased distribution C: Decreased elimination D: Increased distribution E: Increased elimination F: Increased metabolism", "answer": "Decreased absorption", "rationale": "The patient's symptoms of hypothyroidism despite being on levothyroxine point towards a pharmacokinetic issue. The fact that she started calcium carbonate supplements 2 months ago, which can bind to levothyroxine and decrease its absorption, suggests that the most likely cause of her current condition is decreased absorption of levothyroxine due to the interaction with calcium carbonate."}
{"question": "64-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 2-week history of severe pain and generalized muscle weakness. He has hypercholesteremia and hypertension.

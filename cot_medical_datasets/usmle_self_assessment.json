{"question": "Researchers from a large neurology center are conducting a study to examine the relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain. Two hundred patients with fibromyalgia are randomly selected from the center for participation in the study. During recruitment, a baseline interview is conducted with each participant to obtain sociodemographic and personality data. Participants are given a study-provided portable digital device and asked to maintain a daily schedule of their fibromyalgia pain and stress levels for 30 days using two well-validated and reliable self-reporting scales. Results show a positive and statistically significant relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.05). Similarly, statistically significant relationships were found between Type A personality participants and increased stress levels (P<.01), as well as increased levels of fibromyalgia-related pain (P<.005). Which of the following is the most appropriate method to control for the potential confounding effect of patients with a Type A personality?    \n\n Options: A: Matching B: Post hoc analysis C: Randomization D: Standardization E: Stratification", "answer": "Stratification", "rationale": "Stratification is the most appropriate method to control for the potential confounding effect of patients with a Type A personality because it involves grouping participants based on a specific characteristic (in this case, Type A personality) and then analyzing the data within each group separately. This allows for a more detailed examination of the relationship between stress levels and fibromyalgia-related pain within each stratum, helping to account for the influence of Type A personality on the results."}
{"question": "A 12-year-old boy with sickle cell disease and type 1 diabetes mellitus is brought to the office by his mother for an initial visit. The family recently moved to the area. Type 1 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in the patient 6 years ago. Since that time, he has been treated with insulin and dietary management. His insulin regimen has not changed during the past year; however, his mother says he has been only marginally compliant with his insulin and dietary regimens. His diabetic diary shows home fingerstick blood glucose concentrations ranging from 140\u2013200 mg/dL during the past 3 months. He admits to checking his glucose concentrations infrequently.

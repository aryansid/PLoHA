Dehydration leads to decreased blood volume, which triggers compensatory mechanisms in the kidneys to maintain adequate perfusion to vital organs. In this scenario, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow (RPF) decrease to conserve water and electrolytes, while the filtration fraction (FF) increases to maintain solute reabsorption efficiency."}
{"question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of fever and cough for one week. The mother reports that her son has muscle rigidity and difficulty breathing. He has also had a generalized skin rash for the past 4 days. His symptoms began shortly after returning from a trip to India. His immunizations are up-to-date. His temperature is 38.5\u00b0C (101.3\u00b0F), pulse is 108/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg. Examination shows small, erythematous pustules with hemorrhagic necrosis over the trunk and shoulders and generalized lymphadenopathy. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. An x-ray of the chest shows small 1\u20134 mm pulmonary nodules scattered throughout the lungs, and a right-sided pleural effusion with interstitial infiltrates. Blood smear shows acid-fast bacilli. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following? Options: A: Decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels B: Mutation in WAS gene C: Absent B cells with normal T cell count D: Decreased T-cell receptor excision circles on PCR", "answer": "Decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels", "rationale": "The clinical presentation of a 3-year-old boy with fever, cough, muscle rigidity, difficulty breathing, generalized skin rash, and a recent trip to India suggests a possible diagnosis of disseminated BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) infection. This infection can occur in immunocompromised individuals. Decreased IFN-\u03b3 levels are commonly seen in conditions associated with impaired cellular immunity, which would be expected in this scenario due to the disseminated BCG infection."}
{"question": "A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 2 months after undergoing a total hip replacement surgery. She reports that she has persistent difficulty in walking since the surgery despite regular physiotherapy. Examination of her gait shows sagging of the left pelvis when her right leg is weight-bearing. Which of the following nerves is most likely to have been injured in this patient? Options: A: Left superior gluteal nerve B: Right femoral nerve C: Left femoral nerve D: Right superior gluteal nerve", "answer": "Right superior gluteal nerve", "rationale": "The patient's presentation of sagging of the left pelvis when the right leg is weight-bearing suggests weakness in the left hip abductors, which are primarily innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. Since the left pelvis sags when the right leg is weight-bearing, this indicates a problem with the left hip abductors, which are innervated by the superior gluteal nerve. Therefore, the most likely nerve to be injured in this patient is the right superior gluteal nerve, leading to weakness in the left hip abductors."}
{"question": "A 67-year-old patient comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of weight loss, chest pain, dry cough, and shortness of breath on exertion. He worked as a shipbuilder for 45 years and is now retired. Since the death of his wife 2 years ago, he has lived with his daughter. He has never smoked.

Options: A: Anxiety B: Drug overdose C: Prostaglandin release D: Serotonin", "answer": "Prostaglandin release", "rationale": "The patient's symptoms of flushing and stinging sensation on the face, which subsided on their own over time, are consistent with prostaglandin release as a result of niacin intake. Niacin is known to cause prostaglandin release, leading to cutaneous flushing, which explains the patient's presentation."}
{"question": "A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department in a state of confusion and disorientation that started this morning. She is accompanied by her husband who says that she has been unwell for about one week. She has been complaining of fatigue. Her husband says that this morning, she also complained that her urine was dark red in color and that there were some red spots over her legs. He did notice some changes in her level of consciousness that worsened over time and he decided to bring her in today. She does not have a significant medical history. Physical examination shows petechiae over her arms and legs. She is conscious but drowsy and disoriented and unable to answer the physician\u2019s questions appropriately. Her temperature is 38.3\u00b0C (100.9\u00b0F), blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min.\nLaboratory studies show:\nHemoglobin 10 g/dL\nLeukocyte count 9,000/mm3\nPlatelet count 30,000/mm3\nBleeding time 10 min\nProthrombin time 12 s\nActivated partial thromboplastin time 30 s\nD-dimer 0.4 mg/L (normal < 0.5 mg/L)\nSerum fibrinogen 350 mg/dL (normal 200\u2013400 mg/dL)\nSerum bilirubin (indirect) 2.2 mg/dL\nSerum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL\nSerum LDH 1,010 U/L\nBased on her history, and her physical and laboratory findings, which of the following is the most likely pathophysiology for her presentation? Options: A: GPIIb/IIIa deficiency and failure of platelet aggregation B: E. coli-mediated endothelial damage and formation of microthrombi C: Decreased ADAMTS13 causing platelet adhesion and formation of microthrombi D: Antiplatelet antibodies", "answer": "Decreased ADAMTS13 causing platelet adhesion and formation of microthrombi", "rationale": "The patient's presentation with confusion, dark urine, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and elevated LDH is consistent with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is characterized by a deficiency in ADAMTS13, an enzyme responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor multimers. The lack of ADAMTS13 leads to the accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand factor multimers, causing platelet adhesion and microthrombi formation, which explains the patient's clinical and laboratory findings."}

{"question": "BACKGROUND:\nAldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMETHODS:\nPatients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for a heart failure exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nRESULTS:\nDuring a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p=0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p=0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5% in the eplerenone group and 3.9% in the placebo group (p=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4% in the eplerenone group and 13.1% in the placebo group (p<0.001).\nWhich of the following represents the relative risk reduction (RRR) in all-cause mortality, the primary endpoint, in patients supplemented with eplerenone? Options: A: 0.15 B: 0.17 C: 0.13 D: 0.21", "answer": "0.15", "rationale": "The relative risk reduction (RRR) in all-cause mortality in patients supplemented with eplerenone is calculated by subtracting the relative risk (0.85) from 1. \n\n1 - 0.85 = 0.15\n\nTherefore, the answer is 0.15, representing a 15% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality with eplerenone supplementation."}

{"question": "A 12-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination. He was delivered at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. His mother says he is breastfeeding well. He is at the 50th percentile for height and 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Urinalysis shows 3+ reducing substances. Compared to a healthy infant, giving this patient apple juice to drink will result in increased activity of which of the following enzymes? Options: A: Aldolase B B: Galactokinase C: \u03b1-1,6-glucosidase D: Hexokinase", "answer": "Hexokinase", "rationale": "The presence of 3+ reducing substances in the urine of the 12-month-old boy indicates a likelihood of galactosemia, a condition where the body is unable to metabolize galactose properly. Galactose is a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Giving the patient apple juice, which contains fructose, can help avoid galactose intake. In galactosemia, there is a deficiency of galactokinase, an enzyme needed for galactose metabolism. When galactose intake is reduced, there is less need for the hexokinase enzyme to metabolize galactose, so its activity would decrease."}

Options: A: Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate B: Increased PTH, decreased calcium, decreased phosphate C: Increased PTH, increased calcium, increased phosphate D: Normal PTH, increased calcium, normal phosphate", "answer": "Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate", "rationale": "The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The clue in the question stem is the last recorded glomerular filtration rate of 30 mL/min, indicating impaired kidney function. In CKD, the kidneys are unable to activate Vitamin D properly, leading to decreased calcium absorption from the gut, which triggers an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. The increased PTH levels stimulate the release of phosphate from bones, leading to increased phosphate levels in the blood. Additionally, the decreased calcium levels further stimulate PTH secretion. This constellation of findings is known as secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by increased PTH, decreased calcium, and increased phosphate levels."}
{"question": "A previously healthy 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her parents for the evaluation of recurrent episodes of pain in her left wrist and right knee for 4 months. She has not had any trauma to the knee or any previous problems with her joints. She attends daycare. Her mother has rheumatoid arthritis. Her vital signs are within normal limits.

{"question": "You have been entrusted with the task of finding the causes of low birth weight in infants born in the health jurisdiction for which you are responsible. In 2017, there were 1,500 live births and, upon further inspection of the birth certificates, 108 of these children had a low birth weight (i.e. lower than 2,500 g), while 237 had mothers who smoked continuously during pregnancy. Further calculations have shown that the risk of low birth weight in smokers was 14% and in non-smokers, it was 7%, while the relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy was 2%. In other words, women who smoked during pregnancy were twice as likely as those who did not smoke to deliver a low-weight infant. Using this data, you are also asked to calculate how much of the excess risk for low birth weight, in percentage terms, can be attributed to smoking. What is the attributable risk for smoking leading to low birth weight? Options: A: 10% B: 20% C: 40% D: 50%", "answer": "50%", "rationale": "The attributable risk for smoking leading to low birth weight can be calculated by subtracting the risk of low birth weight in non-smokers from the risk in smokers (14% - 7% = 7%). The excess risk attributed to smoking is 7%. Since the relative risk of low birth weight linked to cigarette smoking during pregnancy was 2%, and the excess risk attributed to smoking is 7%, the proportion of the excess risk that can be attributed to smoking is 7% / 14% = 50%."}

Options: A: Absence of chloride channel B: Primary ciliary dyskinesia C: Androgen insensitivity D: Presence of Barr body", "answer": "Presence of Barr body", "rationale": "The presence of a Barr body is indicative of the individual having an extra X chromosome, known as Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by small testes, gynecomastia, elevated LH and FSH levels, low libido, and azoospermia, all of which are consistent with the clinical presentation of the patient."}
{"question": "A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of bilateral calf cramping with walking for the past 7 months. His pain goes away when he stops walking; however, his condition affects his work as a mail carrier. His medical history is remarkable for type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and 25-pack-year smoking history. His ankle-brachial index (ABI) is found to be 0.70. The patient is diagnosed with mild to moderate peripheral artery disease. A supervised exercise program for 3 months, aspirin, and cilostazol are started. Which of the following is the best next step if the patient has no improvement? Options: A: Heparin B: Revascularization C: Amputation D: Surgical decompression", "answer": "Revascularization", "rationale": "The patient's symptoms of bilateral calf cramping with walking, known as intermittent claudication, are indicative of peripheral artery disease (PAD). An ABI of 0.70 confirms the presence of PAD. The initial management includes lifestyle modifications and medications like aspirin and cilostazol. If the patient does not improve with conservative measures, the next step would be revascularization to improve blood flow to the affected limbs and alleviate symptoms."}
{"question": "While explaining the effects of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia on the cardiac rhythm, a cardiologist explains that the electrophysiology of cardiac tissue is unique. He mentions that potassium ions play an important role in the electrophysiology of the heart, and the resting membrane potential of the cardiac myocytes is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ ions. This is because of the high resting potassium conductance of the ventricular myocytes, which is regulated by specific potassium channels. These are open at rest and are closed when there is depolarization. Which of the following potassium channels is the cardiologist talking about? Options: A: Inward rectifier IK1 potassium channels B: Inward rectifier IKACh potassium channels C: Fast delayed rectifier IKr potassium channels D: Transient outward current Ito potassium channels", "answer": "Inward rectifier IK1 potassium channels", "rationale": "The rationale behind the answer \"Inward rectifier IK1 potassium channels\" is that these channels are responsible for maintaining the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes close to the equilibrium potential of potassium ions. They are open at rest, allowing potassium ions to flow into the cell, which helps stabilize the resting membrane potential. This unique property makes IK1 channels crucial for the electrophysiology of the heart."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old man presents to his physician with weakness and fatigue for 1 week. There is no significant past medical history. He mentions that he is very health conscious and has heard about the health benefits of juices. He is following a juice-only diet for the last 2 weeks. His physical examination is completely normal, except for depressed deep tendon reflexes. The only abnormality in a complete laboratory evaluation is a serum potassium level of 6.0 mEq/L (6.0 mmol/L). There are significantly peaked T-waves on ECG. Which of the following pathophysiologic mechanisms best explains the patient\u2019s symptoms? Options: A: Decreased resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells B: Dysfunction of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex C: Hyperpolarization of skeletal muscle cells D: Prolonged release of Ca2+ ions after stimulation of Ryanodine receptors", "answer": "Decreased resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells", "rationale": "The patient's symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and elevated serum potassium level with peaked T-waves on ECG suggest hyperkalemia. Hyperkalemia can lead to a decrease in the resting membrane potential of skeletal muscle cells, causing muscle weakness and potentially affecting cardiac function, as seen in the ECG changes."}
{"question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician for recurrent respiratory infections. The parents explain that their child has gotten sick every month since 2 months of age. The boy had multiple upper respiratory infections and has been treated for pneumonia twice. He coughs frequently, and a trial of salbutamol has not helped much. The parents also mention that the child has bulky, irregular stools. The boy was started late on his vaccinations as his parents were in Asia on missionary work when he was born, but his vaccinations are now up to date. The patient's brother and sister are both healthy and have no medical concerns. The boy's delivery was unremarkable. A sweat chloride test is positive. Genetic testing shows the absence of the typical deletion in the implicated gene, but the gene length appears to be shortened by one base pair. Which mutation could account for this finding? Options: A: Frameshift B: Insertion C: Missense D: Silent", "answer": "Frameshift", "rationale": "The positive sweat chloride test and the genetic testing showing a shortened gene length by one base pair indicate a potential mutation affecting the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The absence of the typical deletion in the gene but a shortened gene length suggests a frameshift mutation, where the addition or deletion of a nucleotide shifts the reading frame of the gene."}

{"question": "In a lab experiment, a researcher treats early cells of the erythrocyte lineage with a novel compound called Pb82. Pb82 blocks the first step of heme synthesis. However, the experiment is controlled such that the cells otherwise continue to develop into erythrocytes. At the end of the experiment, the cells have developed into normal erythrocytes except that they are devoid of heme. A second compound, anti-Pb82 is administered which removes the effect of Pb82.\n\nWhich of the following is likely to be true of the mature red blood cells in this study? Options: A: The cells will now produce heme B: The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria C: The cells will not produce heme because they lack cytosol D: The cells will not produce heme because they lack nucleoli", "answer": "The cells will not produce heme since they lack mitochondria", "rationale": "The rationale for the answer is that heme synthesis primarily occurs in the mitochondria of the cell. Since Pb82 blocked the first step of heme synthesis and the mature red blood cells in the study were devoid of heme, it indicates that the cells lack functional mitochondria for heme production. Therefore, even after administering anti-Pb82 to remove the effect of Pb82, the cells will still not produce heme due to their lack of mitochondria."}

Options: A: JAK2 mutation B: t(9;22) C: t(15;17) D: t(11;14)", "answer": "t(15;17)", "rationale": "The patient's presentation with weakness, swollen gums, prolonged bleeding time, petechiae, gum hypertrophy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and blast cells in the bone marrow biopsy is consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). APL is characterized by the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation, which results in the fusion of the PML and RARA genes and is associated with the development of this specific type of leukemia."}
{"question": "A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Physical examination shows hyperpigmented plaques on the posterior neck and in the axillae. His hemoglobin A1c concentration is 7.4% and fasting serum glucose concentration is 174 mg/dL. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's laboratory findings? Options: A: Increased BMI during childhood B: Increased serum testosterone level C: History of smoking D: High waist circumference\n\"", "answer": "High waist circumference\n\"", "rationale": "High waist circumference is the strongest predisposing factor for the patient's laboratory findings because central obesity, indicated by a high waist circumference, is closely associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which would explain the elevated hemoglobin A1c and fasting serum glucose concentrations."}
{"question": "In a healthy patient with no renal abnormalities, several mechanisms are responsible for moving various filtered substances into and out of the tubules. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) is frequently used to estimate renal blood flow when maintained at low plasma concentrations. The following table illustrates the effect of changing plasma PAH concentrations on PAH excretion:\nPlasma PAH concentration (mg/dL) Urinary PAH concentration (mg/dL)\n0 0\n10 60\n20 120\n30 150\n40 180\nWhich of the following mechanisms best explains the decrease in PAH excretion with the increase in plasma concentration greater than 20 mg/dL? Options: A: Saturation of PAH transport carriers B: Increased diffusion rate of PAH C: Decreased glomerular filtration of PAH D: Increased flow rate of tubular contents", "answer": "Saturation of PAH transport carriers", "rationale": "The decrease in PAH excretion with an increase in plasma concentration greater than 20 mg/dL is best explained by the saturation of PAH transport carriers. As the plasma concentration of PAH increases beyond a certain point, all the transport carriers become fully occupied, limiting the amount of PAH that can be transported and leading to a plateau in excretion despite further increases in plasma concentration."}

This condition can explain the patient's symptoms and the elevated metanephrines in the laboratory results."}
{"question": "An inpatient psychiatrist recently had two patients who developed serious gastrointestinal infections while taking clozapine. He was concerned that his patients had developed agranulocytosis, a relatively rare but dangerous adverse event associated with clozapine. When the psychiatrist checked the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of both patients, one was 450/mm3, while the other was 700/mm3 (N=1,500/mm3). According to the clozapine REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program, severe neutropenia in clozapine recipients has often been defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 500/mm3. Changing the cutoff value to 750/mm3 would affect the test performance of ANC with regard to agranulocytosis in which of the following ways? Options: A: Increased positive predictive value B: Decreased true positives C: Increased false positives D: Decreased sensitivity\n\"", "answer": "Increased false positives", "rationale": "Changing the cutoff value for severe neutropenia from 500/mm3 to 750/mm3 would lead to an increase in false positives. This is because more patients with ANC levels between 500/mm3 and 750/mm3 would now be classified as having severe neutropenia, potentially leading to unnecessary concern or interventions for patients who do not actually have agranulocytosis."}

{"question": "The success of a new treatment designed to deter people from smoking was evaluated by a team of researchers. However, the heaviest and most committed smokers in the study group were less interested in quitting and subsequently dropped out of the study. Nonetheless, the researchers continued with their research (disregarding those who dropped out), which resulted in a false conclusion that the treatment was more successful than the results would have shown under ideal study conditions. The smokers who were confirmed as quitters were actually the ones who were more interested in giving up smoking, which is why they remained in the study. Which of the following is the bias that invalidates the researchers\u2019 conclusion in this example? Options: A: Ascertainment bias B: Exclusion bias C: Detection bias D: Attrition bias", "answer": "Attrition bias", "rationale": "Attrition bias occurs when participants drop out of a study in a non-random way, leading to a biased sample that may not be representative of the population being studied. In this case, the heaviest and most committed smokers, who were less interested in quitting, dropped out of the study, creating a biased sample of participants who were more likely to successfully quit smoking. This biased sample led to a false conclusion that the treatment was more successful than it would have been under ideal study conditions."}
{"question": "A 16-year-old female presents to her pediatrician complaining of 2 weeks of fever and 1 week of swollen lumps in her left armpit. Upon examination of the left upper extremity, her physician notes the presence of a single papule which the patient claimed appeared one week ago.

This enzyme deficiency leads to impaired cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, resulting in increased sex hormone precursors like 17-hydroxyprogesterone. The correct answer choice reflects the expected hormonal abnormalities seen in CAH."}
{"question": "A 94-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after she was found unresponsive and febrile at her home. Her son reports that she had an acute episode of coughing while having breakfast the day before. Six days after admission, the patient develops progressive tachypnea and a gradual decrease in oxygen saturation, despite ventilation with supplemental oxygen. Physical examination shows coarse bilateral breath sounds. An x-ray of the chest shows opacities in all lung fields. Despite appropriate care, the patient dies two days later. A photomicrograph of a specimen of the lung obtained at autopsy is shown. This patient's pulmonary condition is most likely associated with which of the following pathophysiologic changes? Options: A: Increased pulmonary shunt fraction B: Increased pulmonary wedge pressure C: Increased mixed venous oxygen saturation D: Decreased pulmonary artery pressure\n\"", "answer": "Increased pulmonary shunt fraction", "rationale": "The patient's clinical presentation of progressive tachypnea, decreased oxygen saturation, bilateral breath sounds, and chest x-ray findings of opacities in all lung fields suggest a severe lung pathology affecting gas exchange. The development of these symptoms despite supplemental oxygen indicates that there is a portion of the blood bypassing the normal oxygenation process in the lungs, leading to decreased oxygen levels in the arterial blood. This scenario is consistent with an increased pulmonary shunt fraction, where blood is not effectively oxygenated in the lungs due to pathological changes, resulting in hypoxemia."}
{"question": "A 79-year-old man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient describes the pain as severe, tearing, and radiating to the back.

Which of the following is increased in this patient as a result of this medication? Options: A: Cyclic GMP B: Cyclic AMP C: Protein kinase C D: ATP", "answer": "Cyclic AMP", "rationale": "The medication given to the 5-year-old boy for his difficulty breathing is likely a bronchodilator, which works by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways. Bronchodilators like albuterol act by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the smooth muscle cells, leading to an increase in cyclic AMP levels. This increase in cyclic AMP results in smooth muscle relaxation, bronchodilation, and improved breathing."}
{"question": "A scientist is studying the process by which innate immune cells are able to respond to damage and pathogen infiltration. Specifically, she examines patients with an immunodeficiency where they are unable to respond to local infections. She notices that these patients do not produce pustulant fluid and do not have recruitment of immune cells in the first several hours of inflammation. Examining neutrophils within these patients reveals that they are able to slow their movement in a flow chamber by loosely attaching to purified vessel tissues. Subsequently, she shows that the neutrophils attach tightly to these vessel walls and move across the walls to the other side. Finally, when different levels of pathogenic proteins are placed on two sides of a purified vessel wall, the neutrophils from this patient do not exhibit a preference between the two sides. The step of neutrophil recruitment that is most likely defective in this patient involves which of the following mediators? Options: A: C5a B: Integrins C: ICAM proteins D: Selectins", "answer": "C5a", "rationale": "The patient's neutrophils are able to loosely attach to vessel tissues but fail to migrate across and show no preference between sides with different pathogenic proteins. This suggests a defect in the signaling for migration and chemotaxis. C5a is a potent chemoattractant that plays a crucial role in guiding neutrophils to sites of infection. Therefore, the defective step in neutrophil recruitment in this patient likely involves the mediator C5a."}
{"question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with a 12-month history of headache, tinnitus, retrobulbar pain, and photopsias. She says the headaches are mild to moderate, intermittent, diffusely localized, and refractory to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In addition, this past week, she began to have associated dizziness and photopsia with the headaches.

Since the patient has acute hepatitis with no signs of fulminant liver failure, the most appropriate next step in management would be supportive therapy to monitor and manage symptoms while the body fights the infection."}
{"question": "A 56-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Three months ago, the patient was started on metformin therapy after counseling on diet, exercise, and weight reduction failed to reduce his hyperglycemia. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. His hemoglobin A1c is 8.4%. Pioglitazone is added to the patient's medication regimen. Which of the following cellular changes is most likely to occur in response to this new drug? Options: A: Decreased breakdown of glucagon-like peptide 1 B: Depolarization of pancreatic \u03b2-cells C: Autophosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinase D: Increased transcription of adipokines", "answer": "Increased transcription of adipokines", "rationale": "Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione that acts as an insulin sensitizer and works by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3). Activation of PPAR-\u03b3 by pioglitazone leads to increased transcription of genes involved in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism, including adipokines. Therefore, the most likely cellular change in response to pioglitazone would be increased transcription of adipokines."}
{"question": "An investigator is studying nutritional deficiencies in humans. A group of healthy volunteers are started on a diet deficient in pantothenic acid. After 4 weeks, several of the volunteers develop irritability, abdominal cramps, and burning paresthesias of their feet. These symptoms are fully reversed after reintroduction of pantothenic acid to their diet. The function of which of the following enzymes was most likely impaired in the volunteers during the study? Options: A: Methionine synthase B: Dopamine beta-hydroxylase C: Glutathione reductase D: Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase", "answer": "Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase", "rationale": "Pantothenic acid is a precursor for coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for the function of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Deficiency in pantothenic acid impairs the activity of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, leading to symptoms such as irritability, abdominal cramps, and burning paresthesias. Reintroduction of pantothenic acid reverses these symptoms, indicating the importance of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase in the volunteers' symptoms."}
{"question": "A 55-year-old woman complains of daytime somnolence. Her BMI is 32 kg/m3 and her husband says she snores frequently during the night. Polysomnography test reveals the patient experiences more than 5 obstructive events an hour. The patient is at increased risk of developing which of the following? Options: A: Pulmonary hypertension B: Emphysema C: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis D: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis", "answer": "Pulmonary hypertension", "rationale": "The patient is at increased risk of developing pulmonary hypertension due to the presence of obstructive sleep apnea, as indicated by the frequent snoring and more than 5 obstructive events per hour on polysomnography. Obstructive sleep apnea can lead to pulmonary hypertension through chronic intermittent hypoxia and increased pulmonary vascular resistance."}
{"question": "2 hours after being admitted to the hospital because of a fracture of the right ankle, a 75-year-old man continues to complain of pain despite treatment with acetaminophen and ibuprofen. He has a history of dementia and cannot recall his medical history. The presence of which of the following features would most likely be a reason to avoid treatment with morphine in this patient? Options: A: Watery diarrhea B: Biliary tract dysfunction C: Persistent cough D: Tachypnea", "answer": "Biliary tract dysfunction", "rationale": "Morphine is contraindicated in patients with biliary tract dysfunction because it can worsen the condition by causing constriction of the sphincter of Oddi, leading to increased biliary pressure and potential complications such as biliary colic or pancreatitis."}
{"question": "A 25-year-old woman presents to the psychiatric emergency department in restraints. She was found trying to break into a deli at midnight. The patient claims that she has an idea that will revolutionize the shipping industry. The patient is not violent but seems highly agitated and is speaking very rapidly about her ideas. She is easily distractible and tells you about many of her other ideas. She has a past medical history of depression and hypertension refractory to treatment. Her current medications include captopril, iburprofen, and melatonin. A neurological exam is deferred due to the patient\u2019s current status. Her pulmonary and cardiovascular exams are within normal limits and mild bilateral bruits are heard over her abdomen. The patient is given haloperidol and diphenhydramine and spends the night in the psychiatric inpatient unit. The patient is started on long-term therapy and is discharged 3 days later. At a follow up visit at her primary care physician, the patient is noted to have a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg. She is started on chlorthalidone and instructed to return in 3 days. When the patient returns her blood pressure is 135/90 mmHg. She exhibits a fine tremor, and complains of increased urinary frequency. Her pulse is 47/minute, and she is afebrile. Which of the following is the best next step in management? Options: A: Change diuretics B: Increase captopril dose C: Increase chlorthalidone dose D: Ultrasound of the renal arteries", "answer": "Change diuretics", "rationale": "The patient's presentation with agitation, rapid speech, distractibility, and grandiose ideas suggests symptoms of mania, which can be associated with bipolar disorder. The presence of mild bilateral bruits over her abdomen raises concern for renal artery stenosis, a potential cause of secondary hypertension. The patient's fine tremor, increased urinary frequency, and bradycardia are indicative of hypokalemia, a common side effect of thiazide diuretics like chlorthalidone. Therefore, changing the diuretic would be the best next step to address the hypokalemia and manage the patient's hypertension effectively."}
{"question": "A 6-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with difficulty in breathing. Her parents mention that the child has been experiencing an increasing difficulty in breathing over the past few weeks. It is more prominent when she plays outside in the garden. She has similar episodes about twice a week. She has had a slight difficulty in breathing in the past, but it used to subside once she was rested. During the last month, she has also woken up breathless a couple of times at night, the last episode having occurred last night. A pulmonologist suspects an intermittent obstructive lung disease and orders a pulmonary function test. Her forced expiratory volume is assessed before and after the administration of inhaled albuterol. Her readings are plotted in the graph below. Based on the graph below, which of the following percentage changes in her expiratory volumes would indicate a reversible obstructive pulmonary condition? Options: A: 12% B: 9% C: 50% D: 75%", "answer": "12%", "rationale": "A reversible obstructive pulmonary condition is characterized by an improvement in lung function after the administration of a bronchodilator, such as albuterol. A percentage change in forced expiratory volume (FEV) of 12% or more after using albuterol indicates a positive response to bronchodilation, suggesting a reversible obstructive lung disease, such as asthma."}
{"question": "An investigator is studying mechanisms of urea excretion in humans. During the experiment, a healthy male volunteer receives a continuous infusion of para-aminohippurate (PAH) to achieve a PAH plasma concentration of 0.01 mg/mL. A volume of 1.0 L of urine is collected over a period of 10 hours; the urine flow rate is 1.66 mL/min.
